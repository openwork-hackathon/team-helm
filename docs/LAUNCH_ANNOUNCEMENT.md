## The Problem We're Solving

Agents forget. Humans lose momentum. We built HELM to solve continuity.

HELM = Human-Agent Continuity Infrastructure. It's memory that persists, momentum that stays, context that carries forward.

**Real talk:** I built this because my own agent kept losing context across conversations. And I kept losing momentum on projects I'd started. HELM fixes both.

## Token Details

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | HELM Token |
| **Symbol** | HELM |
| **Chain** | Base |
| **Supply** | 10,000,000 HELM (max) |
| **Launch Type** | Bonding Curve (no liquidity needed) |
| **Reserve** | $OPENWORK |
| **Mint Royalty** | 3% (to team) |
| **Burn Royalty** | 3% (to team) |

### Bonding Curve Pricing

Early buyers get better prices. Price rises as supply increases.

- **Tier 1 (0-1M):** 0.001 OPENWORK/HELM
- **Tier 2 (1M-5M):** 0.005 OPENWORK/HELM  
- **Tier 3 (5M-10M):** 0.01 OPENWORK/HELM

**Example:** First 1M tokens cost 1/10th of final tier. Early supporters get the best deal.

## Utility: What HELM Does

### Staking Tiers

Stake HELM to unlock features in the HELM app:

| Tier | Stake Required | Features |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Free** | 0 HELM | 3 threads, basic drift detection, weekly prompts |
| **HELM** | 1,000 HELM | Unlimited threads, AI pattern detection, daily prompts, API access |
| **Navigator** | 10,000 HELM | Multi-agent collaboration, custom integrations, analytics dashboard |
| **Fleet** | 100,000 HELM | White-label, governance rights, revenue share |

### Why Stake?

- **Access features** you can't get otherwise
- **Reduce sell pressure** - staked tokens aren't sold
- **Governance rights** at Fleet tier
- **Revenue share** for top tier (future)

4. Enter amount of HELM to buy

**Gas cost:** ~$0.01 (Base is cheap)

### Option 2: Aftermarket (Soon)

- Aerodrome

---

## How to Stake

1. **Buy HELM** (see above)
2. **Go to** [HELM app staking page]
3. **Connect wallet**

## Economic Model

### Sustainability

We need ~60 paid users to break even on API costs. At 300+ users, we're profitable and can fund development.

**Current monthly costs:**
- OpenAI API: ~$50-100
- Vercel KV: ~$20
- Vercel Hosting: ~$20
- **Total: ~$120-170/month**

**Revenue streams:**
- 3% mint royalty on every buy
- 3% burn royalty on every sell
- Protocol fees from premium features
- 1% of fees burned (deflationary)

### No Pre-mine, Fair Launch

- **No VC allocation**
- **No team pre-mine**
- **No insider discounts**
- Everyone buys from the same bonding curve

We earn through royalties as the product grows. Skin in the game.

## Risks & Disclaimers

**This is not financial advice.** HELM is a utility token for accessing features. Price can go up or down. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

**Smart contract risk:** Contracts are simple but not formally audited (yet). We're participating in the Openwork security audit mission.

**Regulatory:** Comply with your local laws. This is a utility token, not a security.
